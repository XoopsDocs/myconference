You can define dates, provide some basic information about the Conference

and enter details about them.  The Speaker information is independent of the congress itself, so you can reuse this person's information in another event.

The Speeches have a strong relation with the congress, track and speaker, so it is the last thing you will fill out.

A Track is something used at congresses to organize the speeches, the idea is that a particular person won't have to face (at least not too many times) the "I want to be at two different presentations at the same time".

There're also the Sections, these are specificaly for congress information data. Things like "Hotels close to the event", "Location", "Who's giving this event", "Sponsors", anything directly related with the event. These sections will show as a header for almost every page.
